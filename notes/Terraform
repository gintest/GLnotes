TERRAFORM:- 
terraform apply to apply configuration
aws creds are stored in .aws/credentails directory

there are two terraform files, 1- main.tf, variable.tf

main.tf contains the main configuration code, variable.tf contains the variables to be fed into main file.

Example of teraaform configuration:- 

terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 3.27"
    }
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  profile = "default"
  region  = "us-west-2"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-830c94e3"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "ExampleInstance"
  }
}

EXAMPLE of variable.tf:- 

variable "instance_name" {
  description = "Value of the Name tag for the EC2 instance"
  type        = string
  default     = "ExampleInstance"
}

we can use variable in main file as "var.description" from above file.

To get output, create outputs.tf file, then add following data in it:- 
output "instance_id" {
  description = "ID of the EC2 instance"
  value       = aws_instance.example.id
}

output "instance_public_ip" {
  description = "Public IP address of the EC2 instance"
  value       = aws_instance.example.public_ip
}

it will give output while terraform execution.
